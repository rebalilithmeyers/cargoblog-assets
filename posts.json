I will still be on instagram but my efforts will be put into this blog primarily cuz if you aren’t on it, you aint a real one.\nAnd if you are…. You’re the realest of the real ones. So thank you for being that.\nCurrently I’m on the plane to Kazakhstan from Istanbul. Just played a badass fuckin show with Marilyn manson at the BONUS PARKORMAN. It was this cool venue right on the edge of the national forest there.\nI had a blast.\nNow gonna see what Kazakhstan is all about. Will be re watching Borat. Also apparently they’re super good at chess there, so maybe I’ll play a game or two in honor of that.\n\nUP NEXT\nI’m working on a recap from my first solo tour, so keep an eye out for that. Got lots of awesome additional pictures mostly by my homie JAMIE LANGLEY. Shout out to her.\nAnd always shout out to greg, my love, who supports me endlessly in all life and I don’t know what I’d do without him. <3\nBye for now.\n\n-reba\n",
